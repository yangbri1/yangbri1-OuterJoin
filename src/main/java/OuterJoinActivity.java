/**
 * SQL sublanguage: DQL (Data Query Language)
 *
 * We looked previously at INNER JOIN where we will only see data from the tables where there is a match between the
 * columns we join ON. OUTER JOIN will return more results, including null data where the tables did not match based
 * on the columns used for joining. There are three types of OUTER JOIN: FULL, LEFT, and RIGHT.
 *
 * Important Note: There are many implementations of Oracle's SQL standard, and they often differ slightly in grammar
 * and syntax. For instance, in PostGreSQL you can preform a FULL OUTER JOIN, however the H2 database engine used for
 * these activities does not support FULL OUTER JOIN, it only supports LEFT and RIGHT OUTER JOIN.
 *
 * FULL OUTER JOIN will return results from both tables. Any rows that do not have a match between tables will have
 * missing data which will be shown as "null".
 *
 * LEFT OUTER JOIN will return all data from table_left, and any missing data from table_right will be null.
 *
 * RIGHT OUTER JOIN will return all data from table_right, and any missing data from table_left will be null.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  table_left                         table_right
 * | id | character |  species  |     | id | character |        catchphrase        |
 * ------------------------------     ----------------------------------------------
 * |1   |'Bugs'     |'Rabbit'   |     |1   |'Daffy'    |'Youuu're deththpicable!'  |
 * |2   |'Daffy'    |'Duck'     |     |2   |'Elmer'    |'I'm hunting wabbits.'     |
 * |3   |'Foghorn'  |'Chicken'  |     |3   |'Porky'    |'That's all folks!'        |
 *
 * Note that there is no record in the right table for Foghorn, and there is no record in the left table for
 * Porky. When we OUTER JOIN these two tables ON the character column, the missing data will be null.
 * This is useful for finding rows where such a match does not exist, such as textbooks that have no associates classes,
 * or classes that have no associate textbooks.
 *
 *      SELECT * FROM table_left
 *      FULL OUTER JOIN table_right ON table_left.character = table_right.character
 *
 * Note: This example shows FULL OUTER JOIN which is valid in many databases, H2 does not
 * support FULL OUTER JOIN
 *
 * The output of the join would create the following result set.
 * |  id  | character |  species  |  id  | character |        catchphrase        |
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * |1     |'Bugs'     |'Rabbit'   |1     |'Daffy'    |'Youuu're deththpicable!'  |
 * |2     |'Daffy'    |'Duck'     |2     |'Elmer'    |'I'm hunting wabbits.'     |
 * |3     |'Foghorn'  |'Chicken'  |null  |null       |null                       |
 * |null  |null       |null       |3     |'Porky'    |'That's all folks!'        |
